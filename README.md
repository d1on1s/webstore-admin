# webstore-admin

This is the admin part for the webstore project.

A simple E-Commerce website which contains:

- User Signup and Login

- User profile management

- Product Management

- Shopping Cart 

- Order checkout and order history

- Automatic email confirmation

From the architecture perspective, the system is divided into two parts - webstore and webstore-admin. webstore is the front-end website that customer will be using for submitting orders while webstore-admin is used for administration purpose. They are running on two separate servers. The good side is the two apps are decoupled in some way so that they can be managed separately.

The project is written using Java, Spring Boot and Hibernate.
Front-end part is written in HTML/CSS/JS.
